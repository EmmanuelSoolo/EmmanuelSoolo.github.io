Emmanuel Solomon
CS 351 Website Development Project

I made a basic website for my church, that has navigation tabs like Home, About, Sunday Services, Programs, Support Our Ministry, and Contact Us, as their tabs. The Home button takes you to the first page. The About tab describes what the background of the church is. The Programs has nothing yet, because I have not uploaded videos. I made a tab where people can give though Zelle or Cash App in the Support Our Ministry, and Contact Us shows a phone number where people can reach us on.



DOM
In my website first of all with the DOM, I made it show the description or texts inside the sections only, so it does not show some other's section's text instead of the current one being selected. I used the querySelectorAll() for the sections and navagtion links. Also, by selecting a particular links, it shows and all the other sections are hidden with the JavaScript event.preventDefault();, and used the event listener to not make the page jump. Now when I select the Give button, it gives a message.
