Emmanuel Solomon
CS 351 Website Development Project

I made a basic website for my church, that has navigation tabs like Home, About, Sunday Services, Programs, Support Our Ministry, and Contact Us, as their tabs. The Home button takes you to the first page. The About tab describes what the background of the church is. The Programs has nothing yet, because I have not uploaded videos. I made a tab where people can give though Zelle or Cash App in the Support Our Ministry, and Contact Us shows a phone number where people can reach us on.
